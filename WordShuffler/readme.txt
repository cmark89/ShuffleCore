//ShuffleCore
//v1.0
//Made by Corey!


HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:
------------------------
1. Open wordList.txt (found in the same folder) using Notepad.
2. Add all the words you wish to use.  Separate each word with a comma (,).  Example: man, dog, cat, car, etc.  
3. Save the changes to wordList.txt.
4. Open ShuffleCore.


Notes:
-The list of words is automatically put in a random order when the program launches.  
-Once a card has been selected with Stop, that card is removed from the deck.  You can disable this by unchecking the box labeled "Remove Cards".
-Pressing the button labeled Reset will return all drawn cards to the deck.
-If you press Start after the last remaining word has been drawn, it will automatically reset the deck and begin shuffling again.


Important Notes:
-This program will not run if wordList.txt is not with it!!
-If you update wordList.txt while the program is running, you must restart the program before the changes can be seen.
