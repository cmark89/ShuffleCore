//ShuffleCore
//v1.1
//Made by Corey!


HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:
------------------------
1. Create a .txt file using Notepad.
2. Add all the words you wish to use.  Separate each word with a comma (,).  Example: man, dog, cat, car, etc.  
3. Save the file in the Decks folder.
4. Open ShuffleCore.
5. From the dropdown menu, choose the name of the deck to load.  The name is the same as the filename.


Notes:
-The list of words is automatically put in a random order when the program launches.  
-Once a card has been selected with Stop, that card is removed from the deck.  You can disable this by unchecking the box labeled "Remove Cards".
-Pressing the button labeled Reset will return all drawn cards to the deck.
-If you press Start after the last remaining word has been drawn, it will automatically reset the deck and begin shuffling again.


Important Notes:
-Any updates to .txt files will not be seen until the program is restarted.
